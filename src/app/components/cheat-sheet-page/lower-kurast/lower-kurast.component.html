<h2 [routerLink]="'lk-farming'">Lower Kurast Rune Farming</h2>
<div class="content">
  <p>Lower Kurast (LK for short) is a great place to farm <strong>high runes</strong> in Single Player. There are 3 or 6
    <strong>super
      chests</strong> and each of them has only <strong>65536 combinations</strong> (2^16). Some of these combinations
    contain high runes. You can roll a decent map and have 30-60 second runs where you check all 6 chests. On
    multiplayer, maps are rerolled every time, so this is not a viable strategy - you can still check the chests, but it
    will not be such a power method for farming high runes. <br><br>LK runs are also good for farming
    <strong>charms</strong>,
    <strong>jewels</strong> and <strong>gems</strong> as they appear very often in the chests. <br><br> This short guide
    includes everything you need to know about
    LK farming.</p>
  <h3>Runes</h3>
  <p>As mentioned above, there are 65536 combinations and some of them contain high runes. The type of high runes
    available
    in those chests depends on the <strong>player setting</strong> (e.g. type <span class="code">'/player 7'</span>
    command in chat or go to settings). Your chance of getting runes does <strong>NOT</strong> depend on MF. The table
    below shows the runes per player setting, probability to hit a
    specific rune and total probability when farming all 6 chests.</p>
  <div class="grid">
    <div *ngFor="let rune of runes">
      <app-rune *ngIf="rune!==''" [name]="rune"></app-rune>
    </div>
    <ng-container *ngFor="let row of tableInfo">
      <div *ngFor="let item of row" [ngClass]="{'player':item.includes('/p')}" class="not-rune">{{item}}</div>
    </ng-container>
  </div>
  <p>From the table, we can see that is best to farm the chests on players 3-4 or 7-8.<br><br> Let us now take a look at
    some
    probabilities. <em>Probability</em> is defined as <strong>P</strong>, we assume 6 chests are farmed at 30 seconds
    per
    run. <br><br>For players 3-4 or 7-8:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>P(Getting at least one <strong class="rune">Pul+</strong> rune) = 0.00128</strong> or expected <strong>1
      rune
      every 781 runs</strong>, appr. <strong>6.5 hours</strong>.
    </li>
    <li><strong>P(Getting at least one <strong class="rune">Ist+</strong> rune) = 0.00055</strong> or expected <strong>1
      rune
      every 1820 runs</strong>, appr. <strong>15 hours</strong>.
    </li>
    <li><strong>P(Getting at least one <strong class="rune">Sur</strong> or <strong class="rune">Ber</strong>) =
      0.000183</strong>
      or expected <strong> 1
        rune
        every 5460 runs</strong>, appr. <strong>45 hours</strong>.
    </li>
    <li><strong>P(Getting a specific rune) = 0.00009155</strong>
      or expected <strong> 1
        rune
        every 10923 runs</strong>, appr. <strong>91 hours</strong>.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Finding Super Chests</h3>
  <p>In Lower Kurast you are looking for a campfire. There are two huts, one is to the left, the other is on top. The
    first contains 2 super chests, the second 1 super chest. This is illustrated in the image below:</p>

  <h3>A Perfect Map</h3>
  <p>Lower Kurast maps can spawn 2 campfires for a total of 6 super chests. In a perfect map, you will have the waypoint
    and the two campfires very close to it. <br><br>Start from the waypoint, go through the chests and come back to the
    waypoint. Teleport to Act 4, save and exit and repeat. <br><br>Take your time to find a good map, because a few
    seconds save over
    thousands of runs could mean hours. An example of a good (not perfect) map is given below:</p>
